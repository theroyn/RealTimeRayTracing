# Direct3D 12 raytracing samples
This collection of samples act as an introduction to DirectX Raytracing (DXR). The samples are divided into tutorials and advanced samples. Each tutorial sample introduces a few new DXR concepts. Advanced samples demonstrate more complex techniques and applications of raytracing.

### Requirements
* GPU and driver with support for [DirectX 12 Ultimate](http://aka.ms/DirectX12UltimateDev)

  <img src="../../../Assets/DirectX12Ultimate.png" alt="DirectX 12 Ultimate" height="100">

### Getting Started
* DXR spec/documentation is available at [DirectX Specs site](https://microsoft.github.io/DirectX-Specs/d3d/Raytracing.html).

# Known issues
Depending on your Visual Studio version, some samples may fail to compile with these errors:
 * The system cannot find the path specified. *.hlsl.h
 * error MSB6006: "dxc.exe" exited with code 1.

Please see this GitHub issue for details on how to fix it: https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples/issues/657

# Tutorial Samples
## 1. [Hello World Sample](src/D3D12RaytracingHelloWorld/readme.md)
This sample demonstrates how to setup a raytracing pipeline and render a triangle in screen space.

## 2. [Simple Lighting Sample](src/D3D12RaytracingSimpleLighting/readme.md)
This sample demonstrates how to do ray generation for a dynamic perspective camera and calculate simple diffuse shading for a cube from a dynamic point light.

## 3. [Procedural Geometry Sample](src/D3D12RaytracingProceduralGeometry/readme.md)
This sample demonstrates how to implement procedural geometry using intersection shaders and shows usage of more complex shader table layouts and multiple ray types.

## 4. [Library Subobjects Sample](src/D3D12RaytracingLibrarySubobjects/readme.md)
This sample modifies the Simple Lighting sample, and illustrates how to use library subobjects.

# Advanced Samples
## [Real-Time Denoised Ambient Occlusion](src/D3D12RaytracingRealTimeDenoisedAmbientOcclusion/readme.md)
This sample implements a real-time denoiser for 1spp raytraced Ambient Occlusion. It also demonstrates a physically-based specular pathtracer implementation and dynamic geometry support.

## [MiniEngine Sample](src/D3D12RaytracingMiniEngineSample/readme.md)
This sample demonstrates integration of the DirectX Raytracing in the MiniEngine's Model Viewer and several sample uses of raytracing.
